## Overview

Used Spring Data Rest module to create Waracle Cake manager.
Exposes a fully featured REST API **without having to write controller end-points for boiler-plate operations (GET/POST etc.)**.

It also supports advanced searching, sorting and paging without any code having to be written to support these operations.
